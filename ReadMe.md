# PHYSIOASSIST

When people undergo surgery, they would have to rest for a period, especially the elderly, during this 
resting period that would usually last (insert time) weeks, and they would lose strength. To fix this
physiotherapist will be called in to help patients recover their lost muscles and strength through routine
exercises daily, in order to free up time for physiotherapist to see more patient, an application 
that would remind patient to exercise regularly and monitor the exercise done would help physiotherapist 
see more patients, this project consist of two parts, the development of the UI and the logics required 
to develop the application.
